Realm Status Page: Client-Side Edition
======================================

This is a version of my [realm status page][rb-realm-status] written using only client-side JavaScript. Application logic, managed by [Backbone][backbone], is written in [CoffeeScript][coffeescript] at [js/app.coffee](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/wow-realm-status-js/blob/gh-pages/js/app.coffee) and compiled into JavaScript for use in the browser.
